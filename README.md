# MACD_Trading-Strategy_Backtest
MACD Trading Strategy with Backtest

### Summary
Execution and Backtest of Moving Average Cross Divergence Trading Strategy in a set of 3 stocks

### In Detail
In this excercise I developed, executed and backtested the Moving Average Cross Divergence **"MACD"** Trading Strategy.
The concept of this strategy is to **buy** or **sell** when the Exponential Moving Average crosses the "Signal" in hopes of a trend reversal.

In my analysis I downloaded data from **yfinance API** and developed several functions that helped me to better calculate returns and overall measurments of the strategy.

Aim of this excercise was **not** to perform but to test the overall strategy over a certain period of time under certain conditions.
The strategy yielded positive results with an average **7% return** in the overall period.
